# Flack

A Web Programming project using Python, Flask, JavaScript, and websockets (Socket.io)

Flack is an online messaging service using Flask, similar in spirit to Slack. Users will be able to sign into your site with a display name, create channels (i.e. chatrooms) to communicate in, as well as see and join existing channels. Once a channel is selected, users will be able to send and receive messages with one another in real time.
